## Requirements
- Java 8  to build the application
- a running docker daemon to start application server

## Main TechStack
- Gradle 3.5
- Docker
- WildFly 10

## Project documention
You can find the whole project documentation under [project_documentation](docu/project_documentation.md).

## Run and stop the application
Go to project path and executes the following gradle tasks to start/stop the application:
 ```bash
    # Unix based
    ./gradlew chatbotRun
    ./gradlew chatbotStop

    # Windows
    gradlew.bat chatbotRun
    gradlew.bat chatbotStop

    # MacOS
    # you need to execute the docker commands directly
    cd docker
    docker-compose up --build
    docker-compose down
 ```

The following ports are mapped to host:
- 8080 -> 8080
- 8787 -> 8787 (Remote Debug Port)
- 9990 -> 9990 (WildFly Server Manager)
