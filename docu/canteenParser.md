JSoup is a Java library for working with real-world HTML. It provides a very convenient API for extracting and manipulating data, using the best of DOM, CSS, and jquery-like methods.

[Jsoup: Java HTML Parser](https://jsoup.org/)

## Installation
Just add the following line to your gradle dependencies in your build.gradle and refresh the project.
```gradle
compile "org.jsoup:jsoup:1.10.2"
```

## Procedure
The parser collects data of the beuth university canteen in the Luxemburger Stra√üe 9, 13353 Berlin.
To get the requested data, the parser has to navigate through the single pages.

To get data for two weeks, we have to call a page for every day. So at first we have to get all dates for the current and the next week.

The other thing we need is the `resource_id` for the canteen we like to parse. In our case it's the `527`.

If we have the dates we wish to parse and the correct resource_id for our canteen, we loop the dates and call the URL:
`https://www.stw.berlin/xhr/speiseplan-wochentag.html`
with the date and resource_id as params.

After calling:
```java
Document doc = Jsoup.connect("https://www.stw.berlin/xhr/speiseplan-wochentag.html").data(params).userAgent("Mozilla").post();
```
where params represents a string map containing the resource_id and the requested date, we got an Document which we can parse to get all needed data.

The Parser is called right before a given message needs to be checked by the drools rules.

## Result
As a result we got a CanteenData object containing information of dishes for the current and next week.
